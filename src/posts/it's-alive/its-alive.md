The idea was to build this blog with the help of the documentation. Of course, after a while, I spent more and more time reading and less time building it. But finally, It's online, and I can share what I've got out of it:

## 1. Tried building with JAMstack

I was reading about JAMstack, and after attending a few online dev conferences, I wanted to try it. I was reading about JAMstack, and after attending a few online dev conferences, I wanted to try it, and I like it. Hopefully, I'll continue using it more and more on my side projects and professionally.

## 2. Started writing

Writing was never my strong side, but I believe it is a valuable skill to have. Especially as I'm running a small web dev business, and I'm in constant search for new clients and partners. So I'll try to be regular here, and probably on some other platforms.

The next posts will be about the process of building a project with Gatsby, and the difficulties that I encountered while working on it.
